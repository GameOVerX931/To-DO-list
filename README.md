CLICK ON FILE TO DOWNLOAD UNDER WORK ALONG. 


This is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, filter tasks, assign priority levels (high or low), and sort them alphabetically (A-Z and Z-A). The app is also responsive, making it mobile-friendly.
Features
1. Add Tasks
Users can input a task using the text field and add it to the task list by either:
Clicking the "Add Task" button.
Pressing the Enter key.
Each task can have a priority level: High or Low.
Tasks will appear in the task list below, and each task can be marked as completed or deleted.
2. Priority Levels
Users can assign a High or Low priority to each task using a dropdown menu.
High priority tasks are displayed with a red background.
Low priority tasks are displayed with a green background.
3. Mark Tasks as Completed
Users can click on any task to mark it as completed.
Completed tasks will have a strikethrough and turn gray.
4. Delete Tasks
Each task has a delete button that allows the user to remove the task from the list.
5. Filter/Search Tasks
Users can filter the list of tasks by typing into the search bar.
The task list updates in real time to show only the tasks that match the search query.
6. Sort Tasks Alphabetically
The app provides a Sort A-Z / Z-A button to allow users to sort tasks alphabetically.
Clicking the button sorts the tasks in ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A) order.
7. Responsive Design
The app is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
Buttons, input fields, and the layout adjust automatically based on screen size to ensure a user-friendly experience on small screens.
